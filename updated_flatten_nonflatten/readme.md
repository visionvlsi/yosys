# About flatten synthesis vs nonflatten synthesis

<p align="justify">In VLSI design, the terms "flatten synthesis" and "non-flatten synthesis" refer to different approaches for integrating the design hierarchy during the synthesis process.</p>

<p align="justify">Flatten synthesis is a technique where the hierarchical structure of the design is removed, and all modules are flattened into a single module. In this approach, all sub-modules are merged with their parent module, and the resulting design has no hierarchy. This approach simplifies the design and can result in a more efficient implementation in terms of area and timing.</p>

<p align="justify">On the other hand, non-flatten synthesis is a technique where the hierarchical structure of the design is preserved during synthesis. In this approach, sub-modules are synthesized separately and then integrated into the parent module. This approach allows for easier verification and debugging of the design since the hierarchy reflects the original design. However, it can also result in a larger design and longer synthesis times.</p>

<p align="justify">In summary, flatten synthesis sacrifices design hierarchy for efficiency, while non-flatten synthesis prioritizes design hierarchy for easier verification and debugging. The choice between the two approaches depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the design project.</p>

## More on this

<p align="justify">Flatten synthesis is a technique where the hierarchy of the design is removed during synthesis, resulting in a flattened netlist. This means that all the sub-modules of a design are merged into a single module, and the resulting netlist has no hierarchy. This approach simplifies the design and reduces the number of components in the design, which can result in a more efficient implementation in terms of area, power, and timing. However, flatten synthesis can also make the design more difficult to debug and verify because the hierarchy of the design is lost, making it harder to trace the behavior of specific modules.</p>

<p align="justify">Non-flatten synthesis, on the other hand, is a technique where the hierarchy of the design is preserved during synthesis. In this approach, sub-modules are synthesized separately and then integrated into the parent module, maintaining the hierarchical structure of the design. This approach can simplify the verification and debugging of the design because the hierarchy reflects the original design. However, it can also result in a larger design with longer synthesis times.</p>

<p align="justify">In practice, the choice between flatten synthesis and non-flatten synthesis depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the design project. For example, if the design needs to meet tight timing constraints, flatten synthesis might be preferred because it can result in a faster and more efficient implementation. Conversely, if the design needs to be easily verifiable and debuggable, non-flatten synthesis might be preferred because it maintains the hierarchy of the design, making it easier to identify issues.</p>

<p align="justify">It is worth noting that there are also hybrid approaches that combine flatten synthesis and non-flatten synthesis. These approaches aim to balance the benefits of both techniques by selectively flattening some parts of the design while preserving hierarchy in other parts. Ultimately, the choice of synthesis technique will depend on the specific needs and constraints of the design project, and designers will need to carefully evaluate the trade-offs between flatten and non-flatten synthesis to choose the approach that best meets their needs.</p>
